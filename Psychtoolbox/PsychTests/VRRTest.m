function VRRTest(test, n, usedpixx, screenNumber)
% VRRTest([test='sine'][, n=1000][, usedpixx=0][, screenNumber=max])
%
% Test accuracy of VRR aka "FreeSync" aka "Adaptive Sync" mode.
%
% CAUTION: This script is highly experimental, subject to change in the near
%          future!
%
% The test exercises VRR on a system with Linux 5.2+, Mesa 19.0+, latest
% amdgpu-ddx on a FreeSync capable AMD gpu and display combo.
%
% It submits OpenGL bufferswaps / flips of varying 'delay' between successive
% flips and measures and plots how well the hw can follow the requested timing.
%
% Usage:
%
% All parameters are optional.
%
% The 'test' parameter selects the test pattern:
% 'sine' Sine wave, smoothly changing. Exceeds VRR range to test low framerate
% compensation (lfc). 'sine' is the default pattern if parameter is omitted.
%
% 'random' Randomized from flip to flip, within VRR range.
% 'upsweep' linear increasing duration.
% 'downsweep' linear decreasing duration.
% 'upstep' Stepwise increasing duration every 60 flips.
% 'downstep' Stepwise decreasing duration every 60 flips.
% 'const' Run at some constant frame duration.
%
% 'n' Number of flips / trials to run. 1000 by default.
%
% 'usedpixx' Use Datapixx external measurement hardware to get timing ground-truth.
% off by default.
%
% 'screenNumber' Number of X-Screen to test on. Maximum X-Screen by default.
%
% You can abort the test earlier by pressing the ESC key.
%
% Preliminary results with a patch-set targeted at Linux 5.2:
%
% Testing on an upcoming Linux 5.2 kernel showed good behaviour on tested AMD
% DCE-8 (Sea Islands), DCE-11 (Polaris) and DCN-1 (Raven) gpu's within the VRR
% range of the monitor. Also pretty good behaviour on DCN-1 for flip rates below
% the minimum VRR rate by use of low framerate compensation. lfc performance was
% mixed on the DCE-8 and DCE-11 gpu's. For 'upsweep', 'upstep' and some 'const'
% duration it was pretty reasonable or as good as DCN-1. For 'downsweep' and
% 'downstep' and some 'const' durations, lfc didn't do a great job, with actual
% frame durations often deviating by dozens of msecs from requested ones.

% Sine-Wave pattern by default:
if nargin < 1 || isempty(test)
    test = 'sine';
endif

% 1000 flips / samples by default:
if nargin < 2 || isempty(n)

% Don't use external measurement hardware for ground-truth by default:

% Use X-Screen with highest number by default:
if nargin < 4

% Disable OpenML swap scheduling, as vblank count based scheduling is
% meaningless in VRR mode. Instead simply wait for target presentation
